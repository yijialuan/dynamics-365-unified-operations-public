## Feature heading

The **Budget register entries for quantity only** feature enables the ability to post a budget register entry with quantity-only amounts. For example, you could post a budget entry of 32 quantity with a price of zero, resulting in an amount of zero. You may then use this quantity within the context of a financial reporting report to determine a price per quantity.

The **Budget register entries defaulting of amount type** feature enables the defaulting of amount type to revenue or expense based on the main account of the budget line.
